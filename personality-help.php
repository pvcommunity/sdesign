   <br>
   <legend>EXTROVERT</legend>
   You get energized by activity, people, variety and talking <br>
   and when you are at social gatherings and probably prefer <br>
   to talk to lots of people about a wide range of topics. <br>
   You like to be in the thick of the action and are eager <br>
   to share your thoughts and ideas, even if they are not yet<br>
   fully formed. Some of your best ideas come out during conversations.<br>
   You usually get energized by being around people and usually look <br>
   forward to social gatherings. You tend to be outgoing and share <br>

<br>
<legend>INTROVERT</legend>

Your best ideas often come after you've let them "percolate"<br>
for a while inside your head. While you enjoy some social gatherings,<br>
you tend to prefer in depth, one-on-one conversations with a few people<br>
rather than having lots of brief conversations with many different people.<br>
After spending several hours socializing, you'd probably like to recharge <br>
your batteries by being alone for a little while. You tend to listen before <br>
talking and don't like to compete with others for "air time." It may take <br>
awhile for others to get to know the real you.<br>
<br>
<li>Have quiet energy</li>
<li>Listen more than talk</li>
<li>Think quietly inside their heads</li>
<li>Think, then act</li>

<li>Have good powers of concentration</li>
<li>Prefer to focus on one thing at a time</li>
<li>Are self-contained and reserved</li>

<a name="Question2"><h1>How to decide if you're a<br>
    <b>SENSOR</b> or an <b>INTUITIVE</b></h1></a>
<br>
<legend>SENSOR</legend>

You tend to be most interested in talking about<br>
things that are "real", tangible, practical and<br>
concrete - what you can see, smell, taste, touch<br>
or hear. You probably pay great attention to <br>
details and might even be able to relay many recent<br>
conversations close to verbatim. He said (this)<br> 
and I then said (that), etc. You tend to tell stories<br>
with lots of specifics and like others to also give <br>
you all the pertinent details. You would probably<br>

<br>
<legend>INTUITIVE</legend>

to consider future possibilities. When you are <br>
having a conversation, your brain is constantly <br>
making associations and you can easily see<br>
connections to other ideas and concepts. <br>
As a result, you often remember your impression <br>
of conversations and can relay the gist, but not<br>
the precise wording that was used. You probably <br>
enjoy brainstorming ideas and seeing long term <br>
implications and would prefer to be involved in<br>
creating the vision of what could be rather than<br>
executing the many steps involved to get there.<br>
<br>
<li>Focus on the big picture & possibilities</li>
<li>Admire creative ideas</li>

        <br><b>THINKER</b> or a <b>FEELER</b></h1></a>


<legend>THINKER</legend>

You tend to be most comfortable with the part of the <br>
decision making process that involves logically analyzing<br>
the pros and cons and looking at the situation as <br>
objectively as possible, taking the particular feelings <br>
of individual people out of the equation. Your objective<br>
is to arrive at a decision that "makes sense" and is <br>
treats everyone fairly. You probably find it easiest <br>

You tend to be most comfortable in the part of the<br>
decision making process that involves focusing on <br>
how the people involved will be impacted. You tend<br>
to decide based on how you and others will feel about<br>
the situation and have a strong need to be true to your <br>
own personal values. A top priority for you is maintaining<br>
harmonious relationships and avoiding tense, <br>
conflict-ridden situations. You may be very sensitive<br>
to the emotional undertones of any interaction and <br>
probably work to avoid others having hard feelings <br>
or not feeling valued.<br>

<a name="Question4"> <h1>How to decide if you're a
        <br><b> JUDGER</b> or a <b>PERCEIVER</b></h1></a>
 
 <legend>JUDGER</legend>

 You tend to be driven towards closure whether<br>
making a decision, making a plan or completing<br>
a project, and may feel uncomfortable when things <br>
are too unstructured or left undecided. <br>
You probably have two separate modes: "play"<br>
mode and "on-task" mode. When you are "on-task"<br>
you can seem rather serious and get stressed <br>
since it's important to get your tasks accomplished<br>
on time. You may work for long periods of time <br>
without taking a break especially when you are<br>
close to finishing a project. You probably have<br>
a to-do list and derive satisfaction from checking<br>
off completed items.<br>

of information before making a decision. You enjoy <br>
being spontaneous in your social life. <br>
You generally prefer an informal and casual approach<br>
to most things and probably don't like a lot of<br>
unnecessary rules. While you've learned to meet most<br>
deadlines, you may do your best work when you get <br>
the adrenaline rush at the last minute. You might <br>
like to take frequent breaks especially when working<br>
on lengthy projects.<br>
